## Learning Management System
The application enables the coach/instructor to create courses on the go, any video, images or text can be added, blocks can be created, different colours can be added, etc. While the course is being created there are multiple previews for different sizes of devices. The coach also has the ability to store all of his files in the file explorer. After the course is created it is published onto the common page where the list of courses is available. A student can select their desired course from the list of courses.
